day 1: 02/07/2025
12:00 pm to 13:30 pm
designed the name entry, UI UX
ideas : Some events of the stock moving up and down along with random flucuations

day 2:
2pm to 4pm
designed stock, player and overall UI
ideas : premature exit, tick limit (timed game), instructions at start, maintaining leaderboard

day 3:
7:40pm to 8:20 pm
gave an end screen to when player ends, created a condition for game ending by tick
havent done tick based ending mechanism, involves giving option at start and storing that in
    st.session_state and remembering to delete it 
/*
Option A: Use a Cloud Database
Free-tier options: PlanetScale, Neon (for Postgres), [Render MySQL], [AWS RDS], [Google Cloud SQL].

These give you a remote DB URL you can access from your Streamlit app.
*/
i plan to do this

day 4:
Name : stock_stampede

⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT: Add .streamlit/secrets.toml to your .gitignore so it isn't pushed to GitHub.
I'm using pymysql cause streamlit works better with pure py lib
Did the ending, the database, worked from 6:40pm to 9:00pm
